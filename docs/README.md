## ðŸš€ Build & Deployment

```bash
./setup_certs.sh
./setup_volumes.sh
docker compose up -d
```

## Modules

> This project is structured into several modules, each focusing on different aspects:

## DevOps

### ELK Stack â€“ Infrastructure setup with ELK for log management (Major)  
  - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)  
  - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/)  
  - [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/)
### Monitoring system â€“ Add a system to monitor infrastructure and services (Minor)  
  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)  
  - [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
### Microservices â€“ Design the backend as microservices (Major)

## Cybersecurity

### WAF & Vault â€“ Implement WAF/ModSecurity with Hardened Configuration and HashiCorp Vault for Secrets Management (Major)  
  - [ModSecurity](https://modsecurity.org/)  
  - [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

## Server-Side Pong & API

### Server-side Pong & API â€“ Replace basic Pong with server-side Pong and implement an API (Major)

## Web Development  

The website is composed by:  

- **Backend:** [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) with Node.js  
- **Frontend:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling  
- **Database:** [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as a lightweight storage solution

## Website

### Back - Front Communication Diagram

![Back-Front Communication](Back-Front-Communication.png)

### Base of the Website

| Component  | Requirements |
|------------|-------------|
| **Back-end** | The website may or may not include a back-end. If used, it must be implemented in PHP unless the Framework module is selected. If a database is used, it must comply with the Database module rules. |
| **Front-end** | The base language must be TypeScript, with possible modifications using the Front-end module. |
| **Navigation** | The website must function as a single-page application (SPA). Users should be able to navigate using the browserâ€™s back and forward buttons. |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Full compatibility with the latest stable version of Firefox is required. |
| **Error Handling** | The website must be free of errors and warnings during usage. |
| **Deployment** | The entire website must be containerized with Docker and launchable via a single command. |

## Base of the Pong Game

| Feature | Requirements |
|---------|-------------|
| **Gameplay** | Players must be able to compete in real-time on the same keyboard. Remote multiplayer functionality can be expanded with the Remote Players module. |
| **Tournament System** | The game must support a tournament mode where multiple players take turns competing. The system should display matchups and the order of play. |
| **Player Registration** | Players must enter an alias before the tournament begins. Aliases reset when a new tournament starts. This can be enhanced with the Standard User Management module. |
| **Matchmaking** | The tournament system must handle participant matchmaking and announce upcoming matches. |
| **Fair Play** | All players must follow the same rules, including identical paddle speeds. If an AI opponent is used, it must have no unfair advantages. The gameâ€™s aesthetic should align with the original Pong while allowing customization. |

## Security of the Website

| Security Aspect | Requirements |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Password Security** | User passwords must be securely hashed using a strong cryptographic algorithm. |
| **Protection Against Attacks** | The website must be safeguarded against SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities. |
| **Secure Communication** | If a back-end is implemented, HTTPS must be enforced across all communications, including WebSockets (wss). |
| **Input Validation** | All user inputs must undergo validation, either client-side (if no back-end) or server-side when applicable. |
| **API Security** | If an API is implemented, all routes must be secured. Even without JWT authentication, adequate security measures must be in place. |
| **Environment Configuration** | Sensitive credentials must be stored in a `.env` file and excluded from version control. |
